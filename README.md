in this project 
we see Gun Acquisiton in USA 

through answering three questions 
    1. What is the overall trend of gun purchases?
    2. Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations? 
    3. What census data is most associated with high gun per capita? 
   
  The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
